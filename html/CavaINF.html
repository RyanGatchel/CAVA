<h2> OPERATIONS  </h2>
<p> The Gallery will display original visual art projects created by the participating veteran artists. Each artist will have a featured showing to showcase their individual talents providing public exposure, recognition and increased self-confidence.
The Gallery Store will sell the artist's works on an 'as available' basis. Each artist will exhibit with a consignment agreement. This creates an entrepreneurial experience and revenue for the veteran.
The Activity Center is established to provide an environment and opportunity for the veteran to create new work, learn new skills and enjoy the comradery of fellow veteran artists. In addition, workshops and seminars will be available from time to time. These features will provide enhanced skills that may be used for future employment opportunities.
